# housemate-room-organiser
A quick python program that will automatically allocate rooms, given rooms, housemates and preferences

## How to Run
1. Click where it says code.
2. Click download as zip
3. Unzip however you want
4. Double click the .pyw file
5. That's it, it's running  
  
Okay, so you'll need to have python installed to run it right now, because you need python to run .pyw files. I'm currently working on compliling it into an .exe file, but Windows isn't playing ball.

## How to Use
1. Put in every housemate using the textbox next to "Add new housemate", and click add. You can use real names, nicknames, whatever. The program doesn't care.
2. Do the same for each room. It'd probably make more sense to give each room a different name, but that's your problem.
3. Have each housemate take it in turns to put the rooms in order of preference. The higher up the room, the higher the preference.  
  a) Press the up button (+) to increase the preference of that room by one  
  b) Press the down button (-) to decrease the preference of that room by one  
  c) To be a good person, only change the preferences under your name  
4. Once every housemate has set their preferences, click the 'Sort Out Rooms!' button.
5. See which room gets highlighted green for you, that's the room you've been allocated
6. (Optional) Decide to hate the program for giving you a room you didn't want because you had last priority for rooms. The program won't care, I made sure that it didn't.

I take no responsibility for any arguments, fights, or revenge tactics that occur as a result of using this program.
